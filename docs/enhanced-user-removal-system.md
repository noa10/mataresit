  NULL
);
```

## Utility Functions

### `get_removal_candidates()`
Identifies inactive team members who could be candidates for removal.

**Parameters**:
- `_team_id`: Team UUID
- `_inactive_days`: Days of inactivity threshold (default: 90)

**Returns**: Table with candidate information including last activity and inactivity duration.

### `get_team_member_stats()`
Provides comprehensive statistics about team membership.

**Returns**: JSONB with member counts by role, activity status, and recent changes.

## Security & Permissions

### **Permission Matrix**

| Action | Owner | Admin | Member | Viewer |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| Remove Members | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Self Only | Self Only |
| Transfer Ownership | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Schedule Removal | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Bulk Remove | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| View Candidates | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

### **Edge Case Protections**

1. **Owner Protection**: Cannot remove team owner without ownership transfer
2. **Last Admin Protection**: Cannot remove last admin if other members exist
3. **Self-Removal**: Members can always remove themselves
4. **Permission Validation**: All operations validate user permissions
5. **Data Integrity**: All operations are transaction-based with rollback

## Data Transfer Options

### **When to Transfer Data**
- Employee role transitions
- Temporary departures
- Maintaining project continuity
- Preserving historical records

### **When to Delete Data**
- Security breaches
- Policy violations
- Permanent departures
- Data minimization requirements

### **Transfer Process**
1. Validates transfer target is team member
2. Updates ownership of receipts and claims
3. Adds transfer metadata for audit trail
4. Logs transfer details in audit system

## Scheduled Removal System

### **Use Cases**
- Contract end dates
- Probationary periods
- Planned departures

### **Process Flow**
1. **Schedule**: Admin schedules removal with future date
2. **Notification**: System can notify affected users (application-level)
3. **Processing**: Cron job processes scheduled removals
4. **Execution**: Automatic removal with full cleanup
5. **Logging**: Complete audit trail maintained

### **Cancellation**
Scheduled removals can be cancelled before execution:
```sql
SELECT cancel_scheduled_removal(
  'team-uuid',

## Audit Trail

Every removal operation creates comprehensive audit logs including:

- **Action Details**: What was done and when
- **Actor Information**: Who performed the action

- **Context**: Reason, transfer details, cleanup results
- **Metadata**: Additional context and error information

## Error Handling

- `CANNOT_REMOVE_OWNER`: Cannot remove team owner
- `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS`: User lacks required permissions
- `LAST_ADMIN`: Cannot remove last admin
- `REMOVAL_FAILED`: General removal failure
- `INVALID_TRANSFER_TARGET`: Transfer target invalid

### **Rollback Protection**
All operations use database transactions to ensure:
- Partial failures are rolled back
- Data consistency is maintained
- Error states are logged
- System remains stable

- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Progress tracking for bulk operations
- Real-time updates for scheduled removals

- Email notifications for affected users
- Session invalidation (application-level)
- API rate limiting updates

### **Monitoring Integration**
- Audit log analysis
- Removal pattern monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Performance metrics

## Best Practices
