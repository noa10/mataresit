## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The integration uses the existing `attachments` JSONB field in the claims table with enhanced structure:

```json
{
  "type": "receipt",
  "receiptId": "uuid",
  "url": "receipt_image_url",
  "metadata": {
    "merchant": "Merchant Name",
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "total": 25.50,
    "currency": "MYR"
  }
}
```

### Service Layer

**receiptClaimService.ts:**
- `checkReceiptClaimUsage()` - Check if receipts are used in claims
- `getUsedReceiptIds()` - Get all receipt IDs used in claims
- `getClaimsForReceipt()` - Get claims that use a specific receipt
- `addReceiptToClaim()` - Add receipt to claim attachments
- `removeReceiptFromClaim()` - Remove receipt from claim attachments

### Component Architecture

**Core Components:**
1. `ReceiptPicker` - Receipt selection with advanced filtering
2. `ReceiptPreview` - Receipt display with thumbnails and actions
3. `ClaimFromReceiptButton` - Receipt-to-claim conversion
4. `ReceiptClaimDashboard` - Overview and statistics

**Enhanced Components:**
1. `CreateClaimDialog` - Added receipt selection tab
2. `ClaimDetailsDialog` - Enhanced receipt attachment display
3. `ReceiptCard` - Added claim creation button
4. `ReceiptViewer` - Added claim creation functionality

### Custom Hooks

**useReceiptClaimIntegration:**
- Receipt usage queries and mutations
- Utility functions for data processing
- State management for integration features

**useReceiptSelection:**
- Receipt selection state management
- Add/remove receipt functionality
- Selection validation and utilities

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Claim with Receipts

```tsx
import { CreateClaimDialog } from '@/components/claims/CreateClaimDialog';

function ClaimCreation() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <CreateClaimDialog
      open={open}
      onOpenChange={setOpen}
      onSuccess={() => {
        // Handle successful claim creation
        console.log('Claim created successfully');
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Creating Claim from Receipt

```tsx
import { ClaimFromReceiptButton } from '@/components/claims/ClaimFromReceiptButton';

function ReceiptActions({ receipt }) {
  return (
    <ClaimFromReceiptButton
      receipt={receipt}
      onClaimCreated={() => {
        // Handle claim creation
        console.log('Claim created from receipt');
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Displaying Receipt Usage

```tsx
import { useReceiptClaimIntegration } from '@/hooks/useReceiptClaimIntegration';

function ReceiptList({ receipts }) {
  const { useReceiptUsage, enrichReceiptsWithUsage } = useReceiptClaimIntegration();
  const { data: usage = [] } = useReceiptUsage(receipts.map(r => r.id));
  
  const receiptsWithUsage = enrichReceiptsWithUsage(receipts, usage);
  
  return (
    <div>
      {receiptsWithUsage.map(receipt => (
        <div key={receipt.id}>
          {receipt.merchant}
          {receipt.isUsedInClaim && (
            <span>Used in: {receipt.claimTitle}</span>
          )}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
