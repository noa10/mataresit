# AI Integration Implementation Summary

This document outlines the changes made to implement AI suggestions, categorization, and a feedback loop into the receipt processing workflow.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Backend - Enhanced AI Processing

- Updated `enhance-receipt-data` Supabase Function with a new Gemini prompt that:
  - Identifies currency and payment method (existing functionality)
  - Predicts a receipt category (new)
  - Provides AI suggestions for potential extraction errors (new)
  - Returns confidence scores for predictions and suggestions

### Phase 2: Database Schema

- Created a migration file (`20240515000000_add_ai_features.sql`) that:
  - Adds `ai_suggestions` (JSONB) column to the receipts table
  - Adds `predicted_category` (TEXT) column to the receipts table
  - Creates a new `corrections` table to track user corrections for feedback loop

### Phase 3: Frontend - Integration & Feedback

- Updated TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/receipt.ts`:
  - Added AI-related fields to Receipt and ReceiptWithDetails interfaces
  - Created new interfaces for AISuggestions and Correction

- Enhanced `src/services/receiptService.ts`:
  - Updated `processReceiptWithAI` to handle AI suggestions and categorization
  - Added `logCorrections` function to track when users correct AI suggestions
  - Modified `updateReceipt` to call the logging function

- Updated `src/components/ReceiptViewer.tsx` UI:
  - Added display for AI suggestions with accept buttons
  - Added category selection dropdown
  - Implemented UI helpers for suggestion rendering
  - Added confidence indicators for AI suggestions

## Testing Steps

To test the implementation:
1. Deploy database migrations to add the new columns and tables
2. Deploy the updated Supabase Function for enhanced receipt data
3. Deploy the updated frontend code
4. Upload a new receipt
5. Verify AI suggestions and category predictions appear in the UI
6. Accept suggestions and edit data to verify the feedback loop logging

## Next Steps

1. Review and improve the Gemini prompt based on real-world results
2. Analyze correction data to improve AI accuracy
3. Consider adding a visualization dashboard for AI performance metrics

## Database Migration Troubleshooting

- Identified that local migration files were out of sync with the remote Supabase database schema (missing initial `receipts` table migration).
- Resolved Git conflict markers within an existing migration file (`20240804_fix_receipt_storage_bucket.sql`).
- Used `supabase migration repair` multiple times to synchronize the remote migration history table (`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`) with the local migration files.
- Used `supabase db pull` to generate a new migration file (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_remote_schema.sql`) containing the missing `CREATE TABLE` statements based on the remote database structure.
- Ensured the new migration file has the earliest timestamp to guarantee correct execution order.
- Successfully applied all migrations using `supabase migration up`.

## RLS Policy for Corrections

- **Issue:** Users were unable to save corrections due to a Row-Level Security (RLS) violation error (`code: '42501', message: 'new row violates row-level security policy for table "corrections"'`).
- **Resolution:** Added RLS policies to the `corrections` table using Supabase migrations (`add_corrections_rls_policy` and `add_corrections_additional_policies`):
  - Enabled RLS on the table.
  - Added policies allowing authenticated users to `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` their own correction records based on the `receipt_id` belonging to their `user_id`.
