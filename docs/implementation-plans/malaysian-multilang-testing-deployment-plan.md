## 🧪 Phase 1: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Unit Testing Framework Setup

**Objective**: Establish robust unit testing for Malaysian business functions

**Implementation Steps**:
```bash
# Install testing dependencies
npm install --save-dev vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/user-event msw

# Add test scripts to package.json
"test:unit": "vitest",
"test:unit:watch": "vitest --watch",
"test:unit:coverage": "vitest --coverage"
```

**Test Categories**:
- Malaysian tax calculation functions
- Business directory search algorithms  
- Payment method detection logic
- Cultural formatting utilities
- Performance optimization hooks

### 1.2 Integration Testing Suite

**Objective**: Validate Edge Function integrations and database operations

**Test Scenarios**:

#### A. Malaysian Business Recognition Tests
```javascript
// Test Malaysian business detection
const testCases = [
  {
    input: "99 Speedmart receipt with Touch 'n Go payment",
    expected: {
      merchant: "99 Speedmart",
      category: "Groceries", 
      paymentMethod: "Touch 'n Go eWallet",
      taxType: "SST_SALES",
      currency: "MYR"
    }
  },
  {
    input: "Mamak stall with cash payment",
    expected: {
      businessType: "Food & Beverage",
      category: "Restaurant",
      paymentMethod: "Cash",
      culturalContext: "Malaysian"
    }
  }
];
```

#### B. Performance Optimization Tests
```javascript
// Test caching system performance
const performanceTests = [
  {
    name: "Business Search Speed",
    target: "< 100ms response time",
    cacheEnabled: true,
    expectedImprovement: "70%"
  },
  {
    name: "Materialized View Refresh",
    target: "< 5 seconds",
    dataSize: "10,000+ records"
  }
];
```

### 1.3 End-to-End Testing

**Objective**: Validate complete user workflows with Malaysian content

**Test Workflows**:
1. **Malaysian Receipt Processing**:
   - Upload Malaysian receipt → AI processing → Business recognition → Tax calculation
2. **Cultural Settings**:
   - Language switch → Date format change → Currency display update
3. **Search Performance**:
   - Malay search terms → Mixed language queries → Performance metrics

### 1.4 Load Testing & Performance Benchmarking

**Objective**: Validate 70% performance improvements under load

**Test Scenarios**:
```bash
# Performance benchmarking script
npm run test:performance:benchmark
```

**Metrics to Validate**:
- Search response time: < 100ms (70% improvement from 300ms baseline)
- Concurrent user capacity: 1000+ users
- Cache hit ratio: > 85%
- Database query optimization: < 50ms average

## 🚀 Phase 2: Deployment Strategy

### 2.1 Pre-Deployment Validation

**Database Migration Verification**:
```sql
-- Verify all Malaysian tables exist and are populated
SELECT 
  table_name,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = t.table_name) as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_name LIKE 'malaysian_%'
  AND table_schema = 'public';
```

**Edge Function Health Check**:
```bash
# Test all Malaysian-enhanced Edge Functions
curl -X POST "${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/enhance-receipt-data" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SUPABASE_ANON_KEY}" \
  -d '{"test": "malaysian_business_recognition"}'
```

### 2.2 Staged Deployment Plan

#### Stage 1: Database & Backend (Day 1)
