# Real-Time Status Updates Implementation

We've successfully implemented the real-time status updates for receipt processing with the following components:

## 1. Database Updates
- Added `processing_status` and `processing_error` columns to the `receipts` table
- Created an index on `processing_status` for better query performance
- Added a function (`update_processing_status_if_failed`) to update processing status from failed to complete (though direct updates are used in some places due to function parsing issues)

## 2. TypeScript Types
- Added a `ProcessingStatus` type with all the possible states:
  ```typescript
  export type ProcessingStatus = 
    | 'uploading' 
    | 'uploaded' 
    | 'processing_ocr' 
    | 'processing_ai' 
    | 'failed_ocr' 
    | 'failed_ai' 
    | 'complete' 
    | null;
  ```
- Updated the `Receipt` and `ReceiptWithDetails` interfaces to include the new fields

## 3. Service Functions
- Enhanced `uploadReceiptImage` to support progress tracking with an optional callback
- Created a custom helper `uploadWithProgress` using XMLHttpRequest to track upload progress
- Added `subscribeToReceiptUpdates` for real-time Supabase channel subscriptions (specific receipt)
- Added `updateReceiptProcessingStatus` to update the processing status and errors
- Added `markReceiptUploaded` helper to mark when image upload is complete
- Added `fixProcessingStatus` to fix processing status when a receipt is manually edited
- Modified `createReceipt` to set initial processing status to 'uploading'
- Enhanced `processReceiptWithOCR` to update status at different processing stages

## 4. Status Flow Implementation
The receipt now follows this status flow:
1. `uploading` - When the receipt is initially created and the image is being uploaded
2. `uploaded` - When the image upload is complete, before OCR starts
3. `processing_ocr` - When OCR processing begins
4. `processing_ai` - When AI enhancement begins
5. `complete` - When all processing is successfully completed
6. `failed_ocr` or `failed_ai` - If an error occurs at any stage

## 5. Error Handling
- Added robust error handling at each stage of processing
- The system captures specific error messages in the `processing_error` field
- Users can fix receipts with failed processing status via the `fixProcessingStatus` function (e.g., when saving manual edits)

## 6. UI Integration (Completed)
- **`UploadZone.tsx`**: 
    - Displays upload progress with a progress bar (using `onProgress` callback).
    - Shows the current processing stage with appropriate messages using a `ProcessingTimeline`.
    - Subscribes to real-time updates on the specific receipt being uploaded.
    - Displays processing logs in real-time.
    - Handles and displays errors when processing fails, providing a retry option.
- **`ReceiptViewer.tsx`**:
    - Subscribes to real-time status updates for the viewed receipt.
    - Displays the current `processingStatus` using a badge indicator.
    - Shows an overlay on the image viewer during active processing.
    - Provides a "Mark as fixed" button when the status is `failed_ocr` or `failed_ai`.
- **`ReceiptCard.tsx`**:
    - Receives `processingStatus` as a prop.
    - Displays a badge indicating the current processing status (e.g., 'Uploading...', 'OCR Failed').
    - Shows an overlay on the card image during active processing or failed states.
- **`Dashboard.tsx`**:
    - Subscribes to real-time updates for *all* user receipts to keep the list fresh.
    - Passes the `processingStatus` to each `ReceiptCard`.

## Next Steps
1. **Run Database Migration** - Apply the database migration to add the new columns and function (Done). 
2. **UI Integration** - Implement UI components for status updates (Done).
3. **Testing** - Test the implementation with:
   - Various file sizes
   - Different network conditions
   - Simulated errors at different stages
