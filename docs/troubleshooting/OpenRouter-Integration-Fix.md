# OpenRouter Integration Fix

## Problem Analysis

The OpenRouter models were failing when selected by users because:

1. **Dual Architecture Issue**: The app had both client-side `OpenRouterService` and server-side edge function processing, but only the server-side was being used
2. **Missing API Key**: The edge function expected `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable in Supabase, which wasn't configured
3. **No Client-side Integration**: All processing went through edge functions, never using the client-side OpenRouterService
4. **No User API Key Management**: Users couldn't configure their own OpenRouter API keys

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Settings Management (`src/hooks/useSettings.ts`)
- Added `UserApiKeys` interface to store user-provided API keys
- Extended `ProcessingSettings` to include `userApiKeys` field
- Updated default settings and localStorage handling for backward compatibility

### 2. Client-side OpenRouter Processing (`src/services/receiptService.ts`)
- Added `isOpenRouterModel()` helper to detect OpenRouter models
- Added `getOpenRouterApiKey()` helper to retrieve user's API key from settings
- Added `processReceiptWithOpenRouter()` function for client-side processing
- Modified `processReceiptWithOCR()` to route OpenRouter models to client-side processing

### 3. API Key Configuration UI (`src/components/settings/ApiKeySettings.tsx`)
- New component for users to input and manage their OpenRouter API key
- Secure password field with show/hide toggle
- Save/clear functionality with validation
- Informational content about OpenRouter

### 4. Provider Status Testing (`src/components/settings/ModelProviderStatus.tsx`)
- Updated to use actual user API key for OpenRouter testing
- Real connection testing with OpenRouter API
- Proper error messages and status display

### 5. Settings Page Integration (`src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`)
- Added new "AI Providers" tab
- Integrated ApiKeySettings and ModelProviderStatus components
- Clean tabbed interface for better organization

## How It Works

### For OpenRouter Models:
1. User configures OpenRouter API key in Settings > AI Providers
2. When an OpenRouter model is selected for processing:
   - `processReceiptWithOCR()` detects the OpenRouter model
   - Fetches the image data directly from Supabase storage
   - Uses client-side `OpenRouterService` with user's API key
   - Processes the receipt using OpenRouter's API
   - Updates the database with results

### For Other Models (Gemini, etc.):
- Continue using the existing server-side edge function flow
- No changes to existing functionality

## Key Benefits

1. **User Control**: Users can use their own OpenRouter API keys
2. **Cost Transparency**: Users pay for their own OpenRouter usage
3. **No Server Configuration**: No need to configure OpenRouter keys in Supabase
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Gemini processing unchanged
5. **Real Testing**: Actual API connectivity testing with user's key

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Configure OpenRouter API Key
1. Go to Settings > AI Providers tab
2. Click "Get Key" to open OpenRouter website
3. Create account and generate API key
4. Enter API key in the configuration field
5. Click "Save API Key"

### 2. Test Provider Status
1. In the AI Providers tab, click "Refresh" button
2. OpenRouter should show "Available" status if key is valid
3. Check for any error messages if connection fails

### 3. Test Receipt Processing
1. Go to upload page
2. Select an OpenRouter model (e.g., "Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental")
3. Upload a receipt image
4. Processing should work client-side with OpenRouter
5. Check browser console for "Detected OpenRouter model" messages

### 4. Verify Results
1. Check that receipt data is extracted correctly
2. Verify line items are populated
3. Confirm processing method shows in receipt details

## Technical Details

### Client-side Processing Flow:
```
User selects OpenRouter model
↓
processReceiptWithOCR() detects OpenRouter
↓
Fetch image from Supabase storage
↓
Create ProcessingInput for OpenRouterService
↓
Call OpenRouter API with user's key
↓
Transform response to OCRResult format
↓
Update database with results
```

### Error Handling:
- Missing API key: Clear error message directing to settings
- Invalid API key: Connection test failure with helpful message
- Network errors: Proper error propagation and user feedback
- Model compatibility: Vision capability checking

## Files Modified

1. `src/hooks/useSettings.ts` - Added API key management
2. `src/services/receiptService.ts` - Added client-side OpenRouter processing
3. `src/components/settings/ModelProviderStatus.tsx` - Real connectivity testing
4. `src/components/settings/ApiKeySettings.tsx` - New API key configuration UI
5. `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` - Added AI Providers tab

## Future Enhancements

1. **OCR+AI Support**: Implement OCR+AI method for OpenRouter text-only models
2. **Multiple Providers**: Extend to support Anthropic, OpenAI client-side processing
3. **Key Validation**: Real-time API key validation during input
4. **Usage Tracking**: Track API usage and costs per provider
5. **Batch Processing**: Optimize batch uploads for client-side processing
