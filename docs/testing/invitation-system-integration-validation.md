| `track_invitation_engagement` | ✅ Active | User engagement | Seamless |
| `get_invitation_analytics` | ✅ Active | Comprehensive analytics | Seamless |
| `get_invitation_activity_timeline` | ✅ Active | Activity timeline | Seamless |

## 🏗️ Service Layer Integration

### ✅ TeamService (Legacy) Integration
The main team service maintains all legacy methods while adding enhanced functionality:

```typescript
// Legacy methods (unchanged)
teamService.inviteTeamMember()     // ✅ Works as before
teamService.getTeamInvitations()  // ✅ Works as before  
teamService.cancelInvitation()    // ✅ Works as before
teamService.acceptInvitation()    // ✅ Works as before

// Enhanced methods (new)
teamService.inviteTeamMemberEnhanced()  // ✅ Delegates to enhancedTeamService
teamService.resendInvitationEnhanced()  // ✅ Delegates to enhancedTeamService
teamService.cancelInvitationEnhanced()  // ✅ Delegates to enhancedTeamService
```

### ✅ EnhancedTeamService Integration
Enhanced service provides advanced functionality without breaking existing patterns:

```typescript
// All methods return ServiceResponse<T> format
enhancedTeamService.sendInvitationEnhanced()      // ✅ Advanced invitations
enhancedTeamService.getTeamInvitations()          // ✅ Enhanced queries
enhancedTeamService.getInvitationAnalytics()      // ✅ Analytics & insights
enhancedTeamService.trackInvitationDelivery()     // ✅ Email tracking
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Integration

### ✅ Table Structure Compatibility
The `team_invitations` table supports both legacy and enhanced functionality:

**Legacy Columns (Required):**
- `id`, `team_id`, `email`, `role`, `invited_by`, `status`, `token`, `expires_at`, `accepted_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

**Enhanced Columns (Optional):**
- `custom_message`, `permissions`, `invitation_attempts`, `last_sent_at`, `cancelled_at`, `cancelled_by`, `cancellation_reason`, `metadata`

**Integration Benefits:**
- ✅ Legacy functions ignore enhanced columns (no conflicts)
- ✅ Enhanced functions utilize all columns (full functionality)
- ✅ Nullable enhanced columns with defaults (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance (both legacy and enhanced queries)

## 🎨 UI Component Integration

### ✅ Legacy Components (Unchanged)
Existing team management components continue to work:

```typescript
// TeamContext.tsx - Legacy invitation method
const inviteTeamMember = async (teamId: string, email: string, role: TeamMemberRole) => {
  await teamService.inviteTeamMember({ team_id: teamId, email, role });
  // ✅ Works exactly as before
};

// TeamManagement.tsx - Legacy invitation loading
const invitationData = await teamService.getTeamInvitations(currentTeam.id);
// ✅ Works exactly as before
```

### ✅ Enhanced Components (New)
New enhanced components use advanced functionality:

```typescript
// EnhancedInvitationPanel.tsx - Enhanced invitation method
const response = await enhancedTeamService.getTeamInvitations({
  team_id: currentTeam.id,
  include_expired: true,
});
// ✅ Advanced functionality with backward compatibility
```

## 🔧 API Integration

### ✅ Endpoint Compatibility
API endpoints maintain backward compatibility:

**Legacy Endpoints (Preserved):**
- Basic team invitation endpoints continue to work
- Existing API contracts unchanged
- No breaking changes to client applications

**Enhanced Endpoints (New):**
- `/api/team/invite-enhanced` - Advanced invitation sending
- `/api/team/resend-invitation` - Invitation resending
- `/api/team/cancel-invitation` - Invitation cancellation
