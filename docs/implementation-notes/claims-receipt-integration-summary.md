## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
Enhanced the existing `attachments` JSONB field in claims table:
```json
{
  "type": "receipt",
  "receiptId": "uuid",
  "url": "receipt_image_url", 
  "metadata": {
    "merchant": "Merchant Name",
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "total": 25.50,
    "currency": "MYR"
  }
}
```

### Service Functions
- `checkReceiptClaimUsage()` - Check receipt usage status
- `getUsedReceiptIds()` - Get all used receipt IDs
- `getClaimsForReceipt()` - Get claims using specific receipt
- `addReceiptToClaim()` - Add receipt to claim
- `removeReceiptFromClaim()` - Remove receipt from claim

### Component Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components across different contexts
- **State Management**: React Query for data fetching and caching
- **Custom Hooks**: Centralized integration logic
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
