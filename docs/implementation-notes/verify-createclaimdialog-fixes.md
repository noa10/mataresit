- ‚ùå No React warnings about missing dependencies
- ‚ùå No TypeScript compilation errors

### 4. Functional Tests

#### Receipt Selection
1. Open dialog and go to Receipts tab
2. ‚úÖ Click on receipt items to select/deselect

#### Responsive Layout
1. Test on different screen sizes:
   - Mobile (320px - 768px)
   - Tablet (768px - 1024px)
   - Desktop (1024px+)
2. ‚úÖ Verify layout adapts properly
3. ‚úÖ Check that content doesn't overflow
4. ‚úÖ Ensure touch targets are adequate size

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

## Troubleshooting

### If Issues Persist

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check Network Tab**: Ensure receipt data is loading properly
3. **Restart Development Server**: Stop and restart the dev server
4. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed

### Common Issues

1. **Receipts Not Loading**: Check if receipt service is working
2. **Selection Not Working**: Verify click handlers are properly bound
3. **Mobile Layout Issues**: Check CSS viewport settings
4. **Performance Issues**: Monitor React DevTools for unnecessary renders

## Success Criteria

The fixes are successful if:

- ‚úÖ Dialog opens without errors
- ‚úÖ Receipt selection works smoothly
- ‚úÖ No infinite loops or console errors
- ‚úÖ Mobile layout is responsive and touch-friendly
- ‚úÖ Form submission works correctly
- ‚úÖ Performance is smooth and responsive

## Additional Testing

### Integration Testing
1. Test with real receipt data from your database
2. Verify claim creation actually saves to database
3. Test with different user permissions and team settings
4. Check integration with other parts of the application

### Edge Cases
1. Test with no receipts available
2. Test with very large number of receipts
3. Test with slow network connections
