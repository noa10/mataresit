## Critical Issues Identified

### üö® Priority 1: Receipt Content Storage Issue
**Problem:** Receipt embeddings have empty `content_text` fields
**Impact:** 
- 354 embeddings affected (93% of receipt data)
- Search quality severely compromised for receipts
- Semantic search cannot match receipt content effectively

**Evidence:**
```sql
-- Sample data showing the issue
Receipt ID: b45c1d5f-cea6-4246-9b7f-8b2cb9f180f8
Merchant: "PERNIAGAAN WAH SING SDN BHD"
Content Text: "" (empty)
Embedding: Present but not searchable by content
```

**Recommended Action:** Immediate investigation and fix of embedding generation process

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 2: Search Result Quality Validation
**Problem:** Unable to fully test search quality due to authentication requirements
**Impact:** Cannot validate search relevance and accuracy
**Recommended Action:** Implement authenticated testing framework
