# Deployment Best Practices

This document outlines best practices, guidelines, and recommendations for deploying and maintaining the Paperless Maverick production system.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Safety First
- **Always have a rollback plan** - Every deployment must have a tested rollback procedure
- **Use staging environments** - Test all changes in production-like environments first
- **Implement circuit breakers** - Automatic failure detection and recovery
- **Monitor everything** - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all components

### 2. Automation and Consistency
- **Automate repetitive tasks** - Use scripts and tools to reduce human error
- **Infrastructure as Code** - All infrastructure defined in version-controlled code
- **Consistent environments** - Development, staging, and production should be identical
- **Automated testing** - Comprehensive test suites for all deployment components

### 3. Observability and Transparency
- **Comprehensive logging** - Log all deployment activities and decisions
- **Real-time monitoring** - Monitor system health during and after deployments
- **Clear communication** - Keep stakeholders informed of deployment status
- **Documentation** - Maintain up-to-date documentation for all procedures

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy Guidelines

### Rolling Deployments (Recommended)
```yaml
# Best practices for rolling deployments
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1                    # Add one pod at a time
    maxUnavailable: 0              # Never reduce available pods
    
# Benefits:
# - Zero downtime deployments
# - Gradual rollout with monitoring
# - Easy rollback if issues detected
# - Resource efficient
```

### Blue-Green Deployments
```yaml
# Use for major releases or high-risk changes
deployment_strategy: blue-green
validation_period: 300            # 5 minutes validation before switch
automatic_rollback: true          # Auto-rollback on failure
traffic_split: 100                # Full traffic switch (not gradual)

# Benefits:
# - Instant rollback capability
# - Full environment testing
# - Zero downtime for users
# - Complete isolation of versions
```

### Canary Deployments
```yaml
# Use for experimental features or high-risk changes
deployment_strategy: canary
canary_percentage: 10             # Start with 10% traffic
increment_percentage: 20          # Increase by 20% each step
validation_time: 600              # 10 minutes between increments
success_criteria:
  error_rate: "<1%"
  response_time: "<500ms"
  
# Benefits:
# - Gradual risk exposure
# - Real user feedback
# - Data-driven rollout decisions
# - Minimal blast radius
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Best Practices

### Code Quality Gates
```bash
# Mandatory checks before deployment
✅ All unit tests passing (>95% coverage)
✅ Integration tests passing
✅ Security scan completed (no critical issues)
✅ Performance tests within baseline
✅ Code review completed and approved
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Database migrations tested
```

### Environment Preparation
```bash
# Infrastructure readiness checklist
✅ Cluster resources sufficient (CPU, Memory, Storage)
✅ Network connectivity verified
✅ External dependencies available
✅ Monitoring systems operational
✅ Backup systems verified
✅ Rollback plan prepared and tested
```

### Configuration Management
```bash
# Configuration best practices
✅ Environment-specific configurations separated

✅ Feature flags configured appropriately
```

## 🔄 Deployment Execution Best Practices

### Staged Deployment Process
```bash
# Phase 1: Infrastructure (Low Risk)
./deploy-infrastructure.sh --environment production --validate
# Wait for approval before proceeding

# Phase 2: Database Migrations (Medium Risk)
./migrate-database.sh --environment production --backup --validate
# Verify migration success before proceeding

# Phase 3: Application Deployment (High Risk)
./deploy-application.sh --environment production --strategy rolling --monitor
# Monitor closely during rollout

# Phase 4: Post-Deployment Validation (Critical)
./deployment-validation-framework.sh --environment production --comprehensive
# Ensure all systems operational before declaring success
```

### Monitoring During Deployment
```bash
# Key metrics to monitor during deployment
watch kubectl get pods -n paperless-maverick
watch kubectl top pods -n paperless-maverick

# Application health monitoring
while true; do
  curl -f https://api.mataresit.com/health/live || echo "HEALTH CHECK FAILED"
  sleep 10
done

# Error rate monitoring
curl -s "http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=rate(http_requests_total{status=~'5..'}[1m])"
```

✅ Secrets rotated regularly (quarterly minimum)
✅ No secrets in code or configuration files
✅ Separate secrets for different environments
✅ Emergency secret rotation procedures available
```

### Access Control
```yaml
# RBAC best practices
rbac_principles:
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Role-based access control
  - Regular access reviews
  - Automated access provisioning/deprovisioning
  - Multi-factor authentication required
  - Audit logging for all privileged operations
```

## 📈 Performance Best Practices

### Resource Management
```yaml
# Resource allocation best practices
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"              # Conservative request
    memory: "1Gi"            # Based on actual usage patterns
  limits:
    cpu: "2000m"             # Allow bursting for peak loads
    memory: "4Gi"            # Prevent OOM kills
    
# Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
hpa:
  min_replicas: 2            # Always maintain minimum availability
  max_replicas: 10           # Prevent runaway scaling
  target_cpu: 70             # Scale before resource exhaustion
  target_memory: 80          # Conservative memory scaling
```

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Database best practices
-- Regular maintenance
VACUUM ANALYZE;              -- Weekly maintenance
REINDEX DATABASE paperless_maverick;  -- Monthly if needed

-- Connection pooling
-- Optimize connection pool settings
DB_POOL_SIZE=20             -- Based on concurrent load
DB_POOL_TIMEOUT=30000       -- 30 second timeout
DB_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT=600000 -- 10 minute idle timeout

-- Query optimization
-- Monitor slow queries and optimize indexes
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE mean_time > 1000 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Caching Strategy
```yaml
# Caching best practices
caching:
  application_cache:
    type: "redis"
    ttl: 3600              # 1 hour default TTL
    max_memory: "2Gi"      # Memory limit for cache
    
  cdn_cache:
    static_assets: "1d"    # Cache static assets for 1 day
    api_responses: "5m"    # Cache API responses for 5 minutes
    
  database_cache:
    query_cache: true      # Enable query result caching
    connection_cache: true # Enable connection pooling
```
