# Unified Sidebar System - Testing and Verification Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive testing plan to verify that the unified sidebar system works correctly across all routes, devices, and interaction methods.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Route-Based Content Switching

#### Dashboard Routes (Default Navigation)
- [ ] `/dashboard` - Shows main navigation sidebar
- [ ] `/settings` - Shows main navigation sidebar  
- [ ] `/profile` - Shows main navigation sidebar
- [ ] `/analysis` - Shows main navigation sidebar
- [ ] `/teams` - Shows main navigation sidebar
- [ ] `/claims` - Shows main navigation sidebar
- [ ] `/receipt/:id` - Shows main navigation sidebar

#### Search Route (Conversation Sidebar)
- [ ] `/search` - Shows conversation sidebar with chat history
- [ ] Conversation sidebar content loads properly
- [ ] Chat functionality works with unified sidebar
- [ ] New chat button works correctly

#### Admin Routes (Separate Layout)
- [ ] `/admin` - Uses separate AdminLayout (not unified sidebar)
- [ ] `/admin/users` - Uses AdminLayout
- [ ] `/admin/receipts` - Uses AdminLayout
- [ ] Admin routes don't interfere with unified sidebar state

### 2. State Management and Persistence

#### Desktop Behavior (≥1024px)
- [ ] Sidebar state persists in localStorage (`app-sidebar-open`)
- [ ] Sidebar can be collapsed to icon-only mode
- [ ] State restoration works on page refresh
- [ ] CSS variables update correctly (`--sidebar-width`)

#### Mobile Behavior (<1024px)
- [ ] Sidebar always starts closed on mobile
- [ ] Mobile overlay appears when sidebar opens
- [ ] Sidebar closes when clicking overlay
- [ ] No localStorage persistence on mobile

### 3. Navigation and Route Transitions

#### Route Switching Tests
- [ ] Dashboard → Search: Sidebar content switches from nav to conversation
- [ ] Search → Dashboard: Sidebar content switches from conversation to nav
- [ ] Dashboard → Admin: Sidebar content clears properly
- [ ] Admin → Dashboard: Sidebar shows default navigation
- [ ] Any route → Admin: Clean transition without conflicts

#### Content Injection Tests
- [ ] SemanticSearchPage injects conversation sidebar correctly
- [ ] RouteAwareSidebarManager clears content on route changes
- [ ] Default navigation appears when no custom content is set

### 4. Responsive Behavior

#### Desktop (≥1024px)
- [ ] Sidebar toggle shows/hides sidebar
- [ ] Collapsed sidebar shows icon-only navigation
- [ ] Smooth transitions and animations
- [ ] Proper width calculations and layout

#### Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- [ ] Sidebar behaves like mobile (overlay mode)
- [ ] Touch interactions work properly
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints function correctly

#### Mobile (<768px)
- [ ] Sidebar appears as overlay
- [ ] Swipe-to-close gesture works
- [ ] Touch-friendly interactions
- [ ] Proper z-index layering

### 5. Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility

#### Global Shortcuts
- [ ] `Ctrl/Cmd + B` toggles sidebar on all routes
- [ ] `Escape` closes sidebar on mobile
- [ ] Visual feedback appears for keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Shortcuts work across different browsers

#### Focus Management
- [ ] Auto-focus on first interactive element (mobile)
- [ ] Focus trap works within mobile sidebar
- [ ] Focus returns to main content when sidebar closes
- [ ] Tab navigation works properly

#### Screen Reader Support
- [ ] ARIA attributes are correct (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`)
- [ ] State changes are announced
- [ ] Proper semantic structure
- [ ] Live regions update correctly

### 6. Mobile Gestures

#### Swipe-to-Close
- [ ] Horizontal swipe left (>50px) closes sidebar
- [ ] Vertical swipes don't trigger close
- [ ] Gesture detection works reliably
- [ ] Visual feedback on gesture completion

#### Touch Interactions
- [ ] Touch events don't interfere with scrolling
- [ ] Passive event listeners perform well
- [ ] Multi-touch scenarios handled correctly

### 7. Integration Points

#### Navbar Integration
- [ ] Single sidebar toggle appears (not double)
- [ ] Search page shows chat toggle
- [ ] Other routes show navigation toggle
- [ ] Toggle buttons have proper accessibility

#### Chat Controls Integration
- [ ] Chat controls work with unified sidebar
- [ ] SidebarToggle component functions correctly
- [ ] New chat functionality preserved
- [ ] Chat title display works

#### Admin Layout Separation
- [ ] Admin routes use separate layout
- [ ] No conflicts between admin and unified sidebar
- [ ] Clean transitions between admin and app routes

## Browser Compatibility Testing
