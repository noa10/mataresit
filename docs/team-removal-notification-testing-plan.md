4. Verify batch statistics are accurate

**Expected Results**:
- âœ… Notifications sent only to users with enabled preferences
- âœ… Batch audit shows correct success/skip counts
- âœ… Individual audit logs show correct status for each user

### 3. Error Handling Tests

#### Test 3.1: Email Delivery Failure Test
**Objective**: Verify system handles email delivery failures gracefully

**Test Steps**:
1. Use invalid email address for removed user
2. Perform individual removal
3. Verify in-app notification still works
4. Verify error is logged in audit system
5. Verify removal process completes successfully

**Expected Results**:
- âœ… In-app notification delivered successfully
- âœ… Email failure logged with error details
- âœ… Member removal completes without errors
- âœ… Audit logs show mixed delivery status

#### Test 3.2: Database Connection Failure Test
**Objective**: Verify system handles database failures gracefully

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate database connection issues
2. Perform removal operation
3. Verify removal process doesn't fail due to notification errors
4. Verify error logging attempts are made

**Expected Results**:
- âœ… Member removal completes successfully
- âœ… Notification failures don't break removal process
- âœ… Error handling prevents system crashes

### 4. Performance Tests

#### Test 4.1: Large Batch Removal Performance
**Objective**: Verify system performance with large batch removals

**Test Steps**:
1. Create team with many members (simulate with test data)
2. Perform bulk removal of multiple members
3. Monitor notification delivery times
4. Verify audit logging performance
5. Check for memory leaks or performance degradation

**Expected Results**:
- âœ… Notifications delivered within acceptable time limits

## Production Testing Considerations

### Safe Testing Approach
Since we're working with production data, we'll use a conservative approach:

1. **Component Testing**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Mock Data Testing**: Use test data where possible
3. **Audit Log Verification**: Check audit logs are created correctly
4. **Template Validation**: Verify email templates render correctly
5. **Permission Testing**: Verify notification preferences are respected

### Production Validation Steps
1. âœ… Verify database schema changes are applied correctly
2. âœ… Verify Edge Function deployment includes new templates
3. âœ… Test notification preference checks with real user data
4. âœ… Verify audit logging table is accessible and functional
5. âœ… Test UI components display team removal notifications correctly
