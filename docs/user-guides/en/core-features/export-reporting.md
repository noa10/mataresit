**Q: Can I schedule automatic exports?**
A: Currently, exports are manual. Automatic scheduling is planned for future releases. Use our API for automated workflows.

**Q: What's the maximum number of receipts I can export?**
A: There's no hard limit, but very large exports (1000+ receipts) may take longer to process. Consider breaking large exports into smaller chunks.
