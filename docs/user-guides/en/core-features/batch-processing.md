## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

### Processing Strategy Options
Choose the optimal processing strategy for your needs.

**Concurrent Processing (Recommended):**
- Processes multiple files simultaneously
- Faster overall completion time
- Uses more system resources
- Best for stable internet connections

**Sequential Processing:**
- Processes files one at a time
- Slower but more reliable
- Uses fewer system resources
- Best for slower or unstable connections

**Hybrid Processing:**
- Combines concurrent and sequential approaches
- Adapts based on system performance
- Automatically adjusts concurrent limits
- Optimal for varying network conditions

### Rate Limiting and Performance
Understand how rate limiting affects your batch processing.

![Rate Limiting](../../assets/screenshots/core-features/batch-processing/08_rate-limiting_desktop_en.png)

**Rate Limiting Factors:**
- **Subscription Tier** - Higher tiers allow more concurrent processing
- **System Load** - Processing speed adjusts based on overall system usage
- **File Complexity** - Complex receipts may take longer to process
- **Network Speed** - Upload speed affects overall processing time

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Optimal File Sizes** - Files under 5MB process faster
- **Image Quality** - Clear, well-lit images process more accurately
- **Batch Size** - Smaller batches (10-20 files) often process more efficiently
- **Processing Time** - Off-peak hours may offer faster processing

### Error Handling and Recovery
Manage errors and failed uploads effectively.

![Error Handling](../../assets/screenshots/core-features/batch-processing/09_error-handling_desktop_en.png)

**Common Error Types:**
- **Upload Failures** - Network issues or file corruption
- **Processing Errors** - AI analysis failures or unsupported formats
- **Rate Limit Exceeded** - Too many concurrent requests
- **Storage Errors** - Insufficient storage space or permissions

**Recovery Options:**
- **Automatic Retry** - System automatically retries failed uploads
- **Manual Retry** - Click retry button for individual failed files
- **Skip and Continue** - Skip failed files and continue with the batch
- **Download Error Report** - Get detailed information about failures

## üí° Best Practices

### Preparation Tips
Optimize your receipts before batch processing.

**File Organization:**
- **Group Similar Receipts** - Process receipts from the same time period together
- **Check File Quality** - Ensure images are clear and well-lit
- **Remove Duplicates** - Avoid processing the same receipt multiple times
- **Organize by Priority** - Process important receipts first

**File Optimization:**
- **Resize Large Images** - Compress images over 5MB for faster processing
- **Crop Unnecessary Areas** - Remove backgrounds and focus on receipt content
- **Ensure Proper Orientation** - Rotate images so text is readable
- **Use Supported Formats** - Convert unsupported formats before upload

### Processing Efficiency
Maximize your batch processing efficiency.

**Timing Strategies:**
- **Off-Peak Processing** - Process during off-peak hours for faster speeds
- **Smaller Batches** - Break large batches into smaller groups
- **Regular Processing** - Process receipts regularly rather than accumulating large batches
- **Priority Processing** - Process urgent receipts in separate, smaller batches

**System Optimization:**
- **Stable Internet** - Use reliable internet connection for batch processing
- **Close Other Applications** - Free up system resources during processing
- **Monitor Progress** - Keep the browser tab active for optimal performance
- **Regular Breaks** - Allow system to cool down between large batches

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Batch Processing Stuck:**
- **Symptoms:** Progress bar not moving, files stuck in "Processing" status
- **Cause:** Network connectivity issues or system overload
- **Solution:** Pause and resume processing, check internet connection
- **Prevention:** Use smaller batch sizes, process during off-peak hours

**High Failure Rate:**
- **Symptoms:** Many files failing to process successfully
- **Cause:** Poor image quality, unsupported formats, or system issues
- **Solution:** Review failed files, improve image quality, retry processing
- **Prevention:** Pre-validate files, use supported formats, optimize images

**Slow Processing Speed:**
- **Symptoms:** Processing taking much longer than estimated
- **Cause:** Large file sizes, complex receipts, or high system load
- **Solution:** Reduce concurrent processing, optimize file sizes
- **Prevention:** Process smaller batches, use optimal file sizes

### Error Messages

**"Rate Limit Exceeded":**
- **Meaning:** Too many concurrent requests for your subscription tier
- **Solution:** Reduce concurrent processing limit or upgrade subscription
- **When to Contact Support:** If error persists with appropriate limits

**"Processing Failed - Retry Available":**
- **Meaning:** AI processing failed but can be retried
- **Solution:** Click retry button or check file quality
- **When to Contact Support:** If retry fails multiple times

**"Invalid File Format":**
- **Meaning:** File format not supported by the system
- **Solution:** Convert to supported format (JPEG, PNG, PDF)
- **When to Contact Support:** If supported format is rejected
