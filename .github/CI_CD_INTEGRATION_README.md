# CI/CD Pipeline Integration

This directory contains a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline integration for the Paperless Maverick application. The pipeline integrates all deployment automation scripts with automated testing, security scanning, and deployment gates with proper approval workflows.

## 📋 Overview

The CI/CD pipeline integration consists of several components:

1. **Enhanced CI Workflow** (`enhanced-ci.yml`) - Comprehensive continuous integration with quality gates
2. **Automated Deployment Pipeline** (`automated-deployment.yml`) - Full deployment automation with our scripts
3. **Deployment Gates** (`deployment-gates.yml`) - Security and performance validation gates
4. **CI/CD Configuration** (`config/ci-cd-config.yaml`) - Comprehensive pipeline configuration
