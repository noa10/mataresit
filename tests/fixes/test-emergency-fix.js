  console.log('===========');
  console.log('✅ Emergency fix logic should catch "receipts from June 27" queries');
  console.log('✅ Both conditions provide redundant coverage');
  console.log('✅ Case-insensitive matching works');
  console.log('✅ Regex patterns are correctly structured');
  console.log('\n🎯 Expected behavior: Any query containing "june 27" should trigger temporal routing');
}

// Instructions

🧪 EMERGENCY FIX TEST
====================

To test the emergency fix logic:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Copy and paste this script
3. Run: testEmergencyFix()

This will verify that our emergency fix logic correctly
identifies "receipts from June 27" queries.
